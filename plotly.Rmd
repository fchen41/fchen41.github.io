This page is to create a flexdashboard using plotly for that includes at least three distinct plot types. I am going to focus on the dataset from _NYC Restaurant Inspections_.   

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(flexdashboard)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data(rest_inspec)
# Clean the data. 
rest_insp_base = 
  rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(cuisine_description == "Asian", 
         !is.na(grade), 
         critical_flag == "Critical", 
         ) %>% 
  select(dba, inspection_date, phone, score, street, grade, violation_code) %>% 
  arrange(dba)

rest_insp_base 

```
